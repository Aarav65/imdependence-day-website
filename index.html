                                The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian independence emerged from Bengal. It later took root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking the right to appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more economic rights for natives. The first half of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards self-rule by the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate, Aurobindo Ghosh and V. O. Chidambaram Pillai.

                                The last stages of the self-rule struggle from the 1920s was characterized by Congress' adoption of Gandhi's policy of non-violence and civil disobedience. Intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread patriotic awareness. Female leaders like Sarojini Naidu, Pritilata Waddedar, and Kasturba Gandhi promoted the emancipation of Indian women and their participation in the freedom struggle. B. R. Ambedkar championed the cause of the disadvantaged sections of Indian society.

                                Dandi March Day is observed in India from 12th March every year. It is held in commemoration of the Dandi march done by Mahatma Gandhi from 12th March 1930 to 6th April 1930. It was a mass movement started by Mahatma Gandhi against the unjust salt tax imposed by the British government over the production of salt by Indian farmers.Also called ‘Salt Satyagraha’, Dandi March was a 384 Km march that Mahatma Gandhi took from Sabarmati ashram Ahmadabad to Dandi, and then called Navsari. Gandhi started the March on 12th March with around 80 of his closest associates. As they progressed approximately 10 miles every day towards Dandi, they were joined by many others from the villages they passed through.

                                When the march reached Dandi 24 days after its start, on the morning of 6th April, around 50,000 people were part of it. Many historians consider Salt March as a significant event in Colonial India, which united Hindus and Muslims in the freedom struggle.
                                
                                To commemorate the vision of Gandhi in uniting the people of India over an issue as minuscule as salt; Dandi March day is celebrated in India every year. Many political parties, social organizations and common people from all walks of life, enthusiastically take part in the march. Senior political leaders, ministers from state and center, all take part in the march.
                                
                                Dandi March day is primarily observed in Sabarmati Ashram and also at Dandi in Gujarat. People and politicians gather to pay respect to the leader who initiated a series of non-violent protests, taking the nation on the path of independence.

                                The Non-cooperation movement was a political campaign launched on 4 September 1920, by Mahatma Gandhi to have Indians revoke their cooperation from the British government, with the aim of inducing the British to grant self-governance.

This came as result of the Indian National Congress (INC) withdrawing its support for British reforms following the Rowlatt Act of 18 March 1919—which suspended the rights of political prisoners in sedition trials, and was seen as a "political awakening" by Indians and as a "threat" by the British—and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 13 April 1919.

The movement was one of Gandhi’s first organized acts of large-scale satyagraha (civil disobedience). Gandhi's planning of the non-cooperation movement included persuading all Indians to withdraw their labour from any activity that "sustained the British government and also economy in India,"[7] including British industries and educational institutions. Through non-violent means, or Ahinsa, protesters would refuse to buy British goods, adopt the use of local handicrafts, and picket liquor shops.[8] In addition to promoting "self-reliance" by spinning khadi, buying Indian-made goods only, and boycotting British goods, Gandhi's non-cooperation movement called for the restoration of the Khilafat (Khilafat movement) in Turkey and the end to untouchability. This resulted in publicly-held meetings and strikes (hartals), which led to the first arrests of both Nehru and his father, Motilal Nehru, on 6 December 1921.
